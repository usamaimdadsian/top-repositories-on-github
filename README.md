## Other Great Respositories
1. [The System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer): This repo is an organized collection of resources to help you learn how to build systems at scale.
2. [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core)
3. [Cheat Seets](https://github.com/LeCoupa/awesome-cheatsheets): Awesome cheatsheets for popular programming languages, frameworks and development tools. They include everything you should know in one single file.


## Python
1. [The Algorithms - Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python): All algorithms implemented in Python (for education)
2. [Awesome Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python): A curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources.
3. [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook): This repository contains the entire Python Data Science Handbook, in the form of (free!) Jupyter notebooks.
4. [Certbot](https://github.com/certbot/certbot): Certbot is part of EFFâ€™s effort to encrypt the entire Internet. Secure communication over the Web relies on HTTPS, which requires the use of a digital certificate that lets browsers verify the identity of web servers (e.g., is that really google.com?)
5. [What the f*ck Python! ](https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython): Exploring and understanding Python through surprising snippets.
6. [Python Guide](https://github.com/realpython/python-guide):
7. [Comprehensive Python Cheatsheet](https://github.com/gto76/python-cheatsheet)
8. [Pythonic Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/keon/algorithms)
9. [Poetry: Dependency Management for Python](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry): Poetry helps you declare, manage and install dependencies of Python projects, ensuring you have the right stack everywhere.
10. [Awesome Flask Awesome](https://github.com/humiaozuzu/awesome-flask): 

## AI
1. [100-Days-Of-ML-Code](https://github.com/Avik-Jain/100-Days-Of-ML-Code)
2. [Real-Time Voice Cloning](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning]: SV2TTS is a three-stage deep learning framework that allows to create a numerical representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio, and to use it to condition a text-to-speech model trained to generalize to new voices.
3. [Machine Learning Notebooks](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml): This project aims at teaching you the fundamentals of Machine Learning in python. It contains the example code and solutions to the exercises in my O'Reilly book Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow:
4. [Homemade Machine Learning](https://github.com/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning): The purpose of this repository is not to implement machine learning algorithms by using 3rd party library one-liners but rather to practice implementing these algorithms from scratch and get better understanding of the mathematics behind each algorithm.
5. [data-science-ipython-notebooks](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks)
6. [Netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron): Netron is a viewer for neural network, deep learning and machine learning models.
7. [AI Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/kailashahirwar/cheatsheets-ai): Essential Cheat Sheets for deep learning and machine learning engineers
8. [Keras To GAN](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN): Collection of Keras implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) suggested in research papers.
9. [Best-of Machine Learning with Python](https://github.com/ml-tooling/best-of-ml-python)
